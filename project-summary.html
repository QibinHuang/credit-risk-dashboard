    <h1>Credit Risk & Fraud Detection</h1>
    <p>Project Summary & Case Study</p>
  </header>

    <h2>Project Background</h2>
    <p>
      This project originated from a broader goal of making credit systems more transparent, explainable, and secure. The increasing complexity of financial data, along with the growing risks of fraud and misclassification, demands a proactive and interpretable solution. Leveraging my background in data science and real-world datasets, I built a dashboard to simulate credit evaluations and uncover fraud patterns with clarity and precision.
    </p>

    <h2>Business Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide decision-makers with interactive insights into borrower creditworthiness</li>
      <li>Identify and visualize fraudulent activity across geographies and loan types</li>
      <li>Support model transparency using clear performance metrics and segmentation</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Technical Stack</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Power BI</strong> ‚Äì for dashboard design, drill-down filtering, and real-time KPI visualization</li>
      <li><strong>Python</strong> (pandas, sklearn, xgboost) ‚Äì to simulate credit scoring models and flag anomalies</li>
      <li><strong>SQL</strong> ‚Äì for preprocessing over 2 million rows of simulated borrower data</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Implementation Highlights</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Created synthetic credit profiles with features like income, DTI, loan size, payment history</li>
      <li>Trained Random Forest and XGBoost models for fraud classification, achieving >0.90 AUC</li>
      <li>Mapped fraud heatmaps by region to support geographic resource targeting</li>
      <li>Embedded ROC, Precision-Recall curves to show model fairness vs. accuracy trade-offs</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Results & Insights</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Improved interpretability of risk thresholds via score segmentation</li>
      <li>Flagged ~5% of high-risk applicants through model and visual cross-validation</li>
      <li>Demonstrated end-to-end pipeline from raw data to operational intelligence</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Reflections & Future Direction</h2>
    <p>
      This project reflects my commitment to building data products that serve both analytics and stakeholder needs. If implemented at scale, it could guide credit analysts in balancing risk with inclusion. In the future, I would expand the dashboard to connect with real-time APIs (e.g., payment networks), introduce anomaly feedback loops, and explore model drift monitoring. The ability to communicate complex outputs clearly‚Äîespecially in financial settings‚Äîis something I strive to keep improving.
